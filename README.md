# Notes

This is a collection of notes on software developmet, OSX, AWS etc etc that I will probably want to remember in the future.

Ideally, these notes would all be posts on a personal blog, but life is busy and github is easier.

Feel free to fork etc.

- [AWS](aws/AWS.md)
- [Docker](docker/DOCKER.md)
