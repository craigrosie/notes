## Get the parent directory of a path

```python
import os
print os.path.abspath(os.path.join(yourpath, os.pardir))
```

where `yourpath` is the path you want the parent for.

## Requests being slow

Do you notice a significant slowdown when doing multiple requests (to the same host!) using the `requests` library compared to making the same requests in the browser/Postman/etc?

Whenever you execute `requests.get()`, `requests` actually creates a `session` object behind the scenes. I have personally witnessed this overhead slowing down code by around x10 compared to making the requests using Postman.

The solution is to create your own `requests.session` object, which can then be re-used across multiple requests. If you are hitting the same host, it will re-use the underlying TCP connection.

Old, slow version using plain `requests.get`:

```python
import requests

for x in range(10):
    # Has to create a new session for each .get()
    requests.get('test.com?id={}'.format(x))
```

New, fast version using `requests.session`:

```python
import requests

ses = requests.session()

for x in range(10):
    # Re-uses the same session object for each .get()
    ses.get('test.com?id={}'.format(x))
```

## Converting StringIO to bytes

My use case for this is that I was wanting to create an in-memory csv (using the `csv` module), and then upload it to AWS S3. However, the `csv` module expects a file-like object opened in text mode, such as a `io.StringIO` instance, and `boto3` expected a `bytes` object.

The solution is not immediately clear, and also not very googleable, so here it is:

```python
import io

text_like_file = StringIO()
text_like_file.write('Hello world')
print(text_like_file.getvalue())  # Hello world
print(text_like_file.getvalue().encode('utf-8'))  # b'Hello world'
```
